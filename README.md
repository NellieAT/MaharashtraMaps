# MaharashtraMaps
My first set of maps 🗺️ based on the Indian state of Maharashtra.

Plots based on cleaned shapefile (MIT) and official India census data.

Note - transliterated naming convention based on official census convention.

This project includes:
-	A folder with all required cleaned input data
-	The two main .ipynb files (categorical and choropleth)
-	Resultant original sized plots, as shown below

Watch this space for further Maharashtra plots in the future!
